A film by Eugene Jarecki



ASSANGE’S STORY IS THAT OF A RELENTLESS FIGHT 

AGAINST AN EMPIRE THAT WANTS 

JOURNALISTS TO FEAR TELLING THE TRUTH


FOR PEOPLE TO REMAIN IGNORANT 

TO HOW THE WORLD IS TRULY RUN









MALIGNED BY THE MEDIA USING 

NARRATIVES COOKED UP BY THE ELITES

HIS REPUTATION WENT FROM ‘FOLK HERO’

TO ‘COWARDLY RAPIST’ RIGHT AFTER 

EXPOSING WAR CRIMES









THIS DOCUMENTARY SHOWS

THROUGH UNSEEN FOOTAGE OF JULIAN ASSANGE AND THE WIKILEAKS TEAM

AND EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEWS

THE REAL VERSION OF THE STORY




You may think you know the story of Julian Assange.

You don’t.

Much of what has passed for “truth” in the mainstream narrative

was shaped through a careful choreography of 

distortion, discrediting, and erasure. 





WikiLeaks, once a global lightning rod, 

has been buried beneath the churn of 

24/7 news and state-sanctioned amnesia. 





But the mechanisms Assange exposed 

surveillance
secrecy
impunity

haven’t vanished. 




They’ve been refined, institutionalised, 

and turned into infrastructure.

Beginning in 2006 with the ideals of 

the cypherpunk movement,   







WikiLeaks built a secure publishing platform 

that bypassed traditional media gatekeepers. 





It published the infamous Collateral Murder video in 2010, 

followed by the Afghan and Iraq War Logs, 

and the Cablegate diplomatic archives

transforming how the public understood 

war, diplomacy, and power. 





In the process, Assange became both symbol and target.

This film, shot over four years and during 

Assange’s detention in H.M. Belmarsh prison, 

traces the collapse of his sanctuary, the turning of political tides 

in Ecuador, and the global machinery that moved to silence him. 





With the stroke of a pen and 

a $6 billion IMF deal, 

his asylum ended. 






What followed was 

incarceration, isolation, and eventual release 

through a plea deal under the Espionage Act...

a historic first for a publisher.






Jarecki’s film is not a biography. 

It is a look at the system complicity, legal overreach, 

and the quiet erasure of dissent. 


At stake is not just the fate of a man, 

but the future of journalism itself.





Crypto and Assange







In 2010, WikiLeaks was financially blacklisted by 

Visa, Mastercard, PayPal. 

Assange turned to Bitcoin. 


"Bitcoin is the real Occupy Wall Street," he declared.





Early BTC donations helped WikiLeaks survive.

The Cypherpunk roots of Bitcoin and WikiLeaks are the same: 


privacy, decentralisation, freedom.





AssangeDAO (2022) raised $53M in a week for Assange’s legal defense.

The crypto world has already spoken.

This film gives that voice a platform.





Our film challenges entrenched narratives. 

We have already met resistance in traditional media channels.

Corporate platforms benefit from a distracted audience and a discredited Assange.

We need decentralised support to bypass censorship and algorithmic throttling.

You know the architecture of silence. Help us break it.





What We're Asking. 





Initial crypto contribution to fund distribution, promotion  and an impact campaign.

Public endorsement (if desired) to galvanise the broader crypto sphere.

Strategic guidance or connection to Bitcoin-aligned distribution tools.

We’re not looking for control—just for belief. Help us finish this story.





Use of Funds





Academy screenings and crypto-native distribution (NFT access passes, decentralised streaming)

Legal and security support for contributors in high-risk zones

Aggressive promotional push now that Assange is free and public attention is resurgent

Transparency guaranteed: funds held in multi-sig wallet with real-time public ledger.+




Why You?





Your voice has stood consistently for 

decentralisation, free speech, Bitcoin as resistance. 

You understand that speech without infrastructure is performative. 





Assange’s prosecution is a prosecution of 

infrastructure: publishing, cryptography, financial independence.

Supporting this film continues the work you’ve always done.

This is the film that corporate platforms will try to forget. 






The crypto community

the only network that kept Assange alive—can now ensure he’s not erased.





Let’s finish what we started.
