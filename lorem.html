A film by Eugene Jarecki




ASSANGE’S STORY IS THAT OF A RELENTLESS FIGHT 

AGAINST AN EMPIRE THAT WANTS JOURNALISTS TO FEAR TELLING THE TRUTH

FOR PEOPLE TO REMAIN IGNORANT TO HOW THE WORLD IS RUN






THIS DOCUMENTARY USES UNSEEN FOOTAGE OF JULIAN ASSANGE AND THE WIKILEAKS TEAM

AS WELL AS EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEWS WITH THOSE WHO WERE THERE ON THE JOURNEY

TO TELL THE REAL VERSION OF THE STORY





You may think you know the story.

you don’t.




Much of what has passed for “truth” in the mainstream narrative 

was shaped through a careful choreography of distortion, discrediting, and erasure. 





WikiLeaks, once a global lightning rod, has been buried beneath the churn of 24/7 news 
and state-sanctioned amnesia. 

But the mechanisms Assange exposed 

surveillance, secrecy, impunity 

haven’t vanished. 




Beginning in 2006 with the ideals of the cypherpunk movement, 

WikiLeaks built a secure publishing platform that bypassed traditional media gatekeepers. 

It published the infamous Collateral Murder video in 2010, 

followed by the Afghan and Iraq War Logs, and the Cablegate diplomatic archives, 


transforming how the public understood war, diplomacy, and power. 






In the process, 

Assange became both symbol and target.







This film, shot over four years and during Assange’s detention in H.M. Belmarsh prison, 

traces the collapse of his sanctuary, the turning of political tides in Ecuador, 

and the global machinery that moved to silence him. 






With the stroke of a pen and a $6 billion IMF deal, his asylum ended. 

What followed was

incarceration, 
isolation, 
and eventual release through a plea deal under the Espionage Act 


a historic first for a publisher.





Crypto and Assange





In 2010, WikiLeaks was financially blacklisted by 

Visa, Mastercard, and PayPal. 

Assange turned to cryptocurrency. 

"Bitcoin is the real Occupy Wall Street," 






Early BTC donations helped WikiLeaks survive.

The Cypherpunk roots of Bitcoin and WikiLeaks are the same: 

privacy, 
decentralisation, 
freedom.

AssangeDAO (2022) raised $53M in a week for Assange’s legal defense.

The crypto world has already spoken. This film gives that voice a platform.





Our film challenges entrenched narratives. We have already met resistance in traditional media channels.

Corporate platforms benefit from a distracted audience and a discredited Assange.





We need decentralised support to bypass censorship and algorithmic throttling.

You know the architecture of silence. 


Help us break itþ






What We're Asking




Initial crypto contribution to fund distribution, promotion and an impact campaign.






Public endorsement (if desired) to galvanise the broader crypto sphere.

Strategic guidance or connection to Bitcoin-aligned distribution tools.







Use of Funds







Academy screenings and crypto-native distribution (NFT access passes, decentralised streaming)


Legal and security support for contributors in high-risk zones


Aggressive promotional push now that Assange is free and public attention is resurgent








Transparency guaranteed: 

funds held in multi-sig wallet with real-time public ledger.






Why You?





Your voice has stood consistently for 

decentralisation, free speech, and Bitcoin as resistance. 


You understand that speech without infrastructure is performative. 





Assange’s prosecution is a prosecution of infrastructure: publishing, cryptography, financial independence.

Supporting this film continues the work you’ve always done.

The crypto community, the only network that kept Assange alive 

can now ensure he’s not erased.






Let’s finish what we started.
